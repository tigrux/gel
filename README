The Glib-Extension-Language (or just Gel) is a dynamic language
completely written in GLib and C, but inspired in Scheme and Python.

It is very easy to use, since everything is an literal, symbol or symbol.

The Code is very small, just 3 public modules, and a few more of support.

What makes Gel different is that everything is implemented in GLib:
- Symbols are GValues.
- Functions are GClosures.
- Arrays are GArray.
- Objects are instantiated by type name.
- Parsing is done with GScanner.
- Symbols are resolved using GHashTables.
- Arithmetic and logic are exposed as functions that take GValue.

Bindings for Vala are provided (see examples/test.vala)
Support for gobject-introspection is currently is not complete but works.

However, the project is not mature yet, so speed or elegance is not a
priority yet. The current goal is to prevent memory leaks and provide
an API comfortable to use from both C, Vala and Gel.

A few examples are available in examples/
